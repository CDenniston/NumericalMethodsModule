    "In many applications, we encounter matrices with special structure.  Making use of this structure can often allow lower memory use, faster algorithms, or both.  \n",

    "**Theorem:** If $A$ is strictly diagonally dominant then $A$ is nonsingular and Gaussian elmiination without pivoting doesn't break down (no zero pivot) and is stable with respect to roundoff error growth.\n",

If we take advantage of all the zeros in these sparse matrices we can often reduce the cost of solving the system down to something that is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ rather than $n^3/3$, a *huge* saving.  There is also the potential to save storage.\n",
