    "## Faster Convergence and Newton's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we found that the magnitude of $g'(p)$ plays a significant role in how fast a fixed point iteration scheme converges.  In this section we address the quesion of convergence when $g'(p)=0$. \n",

    "> **Theorem:**\n",
    "> - If $p$ is a solution to $x=g(x)$ with $g'(p)=0$ (assuming $g$ and $g'$ are continuous functions), then there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for all $p_0\\in(p-\\delta,p+\\delta)$, fixed point iteration coverges quadratically (or has order of convergence 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the proof, it is not too hard to show that if $g'$ is continuous that if $g'(p)=0$ then there must be some neighborhood of $p$ where $|g'(x)| \\leq k < 1$ (i.e. there exists $\\delta$ where $|g'(x)| \\leq k < 1$ in $(p-\\delta,p+\\delta)$).  You can then use the Mean Value theorem to show that $g(x)$ maps this neighborhood of $p$ onto itself.  As a result, we have the conditions required by our fixed point convergence theorem so that choosing our initial guess in this interval will result in convergence to a unique fixed point.  To see that this give quadratic convergence, note that given $p_i\\in (p-\\delta,p+\\delta)$ we can expand $g(x)$ in a Taylor series about $p$,\n",

    "**Example:** A *really* old fixed point scheme for [finding square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root) (a description appears in Book 1 of Metrica by Heron of Alexandria from the first century C.E. but it is also clear that it was actually also widely known several hundred years earlier by ancient Indian and Chinese mathematians and as much as two thousand years earlier by ancient Mesopotanians).  The scheme is based on the idea that if you have a guess $x_i$ for the square root of a number $y$, then $y/x_i$ will be greater/less than the true square root if $x_i$ is too small/large.  As such, the average of $x_i$ and $y/x_i$ should be closer.  The fixed point scheme thus becomes\n",
